### STANDARD mode ping parameters
###
### In standard mode, a batch of <stdcount> packets is sent every 
### <stdinterval> seconds. Within the batch, packets are sent
### every 1 second and are assumed to have a very short round
### trip time. Timeout for the batch is calculated as 2 * <stdcount>
### seconds. If no packets return within the time, OUTAGE mode is enabled.

# Site or IP to ping
stdsite: 8.8.8.8

# Interval in seconds between batches. Should be long enough not to 
# spam the pings but short enough to catch outage when it starts.
stdinterval: 120

# Packet size. Set to a higher number to better record RTTs.
# Minimum is 24.
stdsize: 1000

# Packet count per batch. Moe than one to avoid switching to outage 
# mode because of a single dropped packet. 
stdcount: 5

### OUTAGE mode ping parameters
###
### Outage mode assumes that the batch will hit timeout.
### Timeout for the batch is calculated as <outcount> * <outinterval>
### seconds. Packets within the batch are sent every <outinterval>
### seconds and next batch starts immediately after last one times out.
### If all packets are returned within the time, program returns to
### STANDARD mode.

# Site or IP to ping
outsite: 8.8.8.8

# Interval in seconds between packets in the batch.
outinterval: 3

# Packet count per batch 
outcount: 10
